## Part 5: Final Configuration Check

### Verify Your .env File

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```env
# Telegram
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABCdef...

# Google Sheets
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=data/google_credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/...

# AI Provider (choose one)
AI_PROVIDER=openai

# OpenAI (if using)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# OR Anthropic (if using)
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
```

### Verify File Structure

```
data/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exercises.csv              ‚úÖ (should exist)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ google_credentials.json    ‚úÖ (you created this)

## Part 7: Test the Bot

### 7.1 Find Your Bot

1. Open Telegram
2. Search for your bot username (the one you created with BotFather)
3. Start a chat

### 7.2 Test Basic Commands

```
You: /start
Bot: (Should send welcome message)

You: /setweek 1
Bot: ‚úÖ Set to Week 1

You: /setday 1
Bot: (Shows Day 1 exercises)

You: 3 sets of 10 bench press at 60kg
Bot: (Should process and log to Google Sheets)
```

### 7.3 Verify Google Sheets

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Navigate to Day 1
3. Check Week 1 columns
4. You should see your workout logged!

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond

**Check:**
- Is `main.py` still running in your terminal?
- Did you use the correct bot username in Telegram?
- Is the TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN correct?

**Fix:** Restart the bot and try again

### "Can't connect to Google Sheets"

**Check:**
- Is `google_credentials.json` in the `data/` folder?
- Did you share the sheet with the service account email?
- Is the GOOGLE_SHEET_URL correct?

**Fix:** See [GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md) troubleshooting section

### "Invalid API key" for AI

**Check:**
- Did you copy the entire API key?
- Are there extra spaces in the `.env` file?
- Do you have credits/billing set up?

**Fix:** See [AI_API_SETUP.md](AI_API_SETUP.md) troubleshooting section

### "Exercise not found"

**Check:**
- Is the exercise in your CSV file?
- Try being more specific with the exercise name

**Fix:** Use `/today` to see available exercises for the day

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Bot is slow to respond

**Cause:** AI API might be slow
**Solution:** This is normal for the first request. Subsequent requests will be faster.

### Issue: Wrong exercise logged

**Cause:** AI misunderstood the exercise name
**Solution:** Be more specific, or use the exact exercise name from `/today`

### Issue: Can't find service account email

**Cause:** Need to look in the credentials file
**Solution:**
```bash
# On Windows PowerShell:
Select-String -Path data/google_credentials.json -Pattern "client_email"

# On Mac/Linux:
grep "client_email" data/google_credentials.json
```

## Next Steps

Once everything is working:

1. **Set your current week:** `/setweek 1`
2. **Set your training day:** `/setday 1`
3. **Start logging workouts!**
4. **Use `/help`** to see all commands
5. **Check Google Sheets** after each workout to verify logging

---

## Security Reminders

- ‚úÖ `.env` is in `.gitignore` - never commit it!
- ‚úÖ `google_credentials.json` is in `.gitignore` - never share it!
- ‚úÖ Keep your API keys private
- ‚úÖ Set spending limits on AI APIs
- ‚úÖ Rotate keys periodically

---

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. Check the detailed setup guides in the `docs/` folder
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Check that all services (Telegram, Google, AI) are working independently
4. Look for error messages in the terminal where the bot is running
